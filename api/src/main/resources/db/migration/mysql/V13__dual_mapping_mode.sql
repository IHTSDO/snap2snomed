/* 
   A union is created as a view as the full query cannot be represented by JPAQuery or BlazeJPAQuery.  

   JPAQuery does not support unions.

   BlazeJPAQuery claims to support union but it doesn't support the call of a constructor from the second select of a union 
   .. from the blaze manual .. "The SELECT clause can be used to specify projections that should be returned by a query. 
   Blaze Persistence completely aligns with JPQL regarding the support of the SELECT clause, except for constructor expressions."
   The workaround "selectNew" only works for CriteriaBuilder, not
   QueryDSL and then "selectNew" cannot be called within a union https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/565"
